Demo: Collaborative Agents with Private and Shared Memory

This demo shows two agents collaborating:
- Research Agent: Finds and stores information in private + shared memory
- Writing Agent: Creates content using shared information + private writing preferences

Each agent maintains:
1. Private memory (their own namespace)
2. Shared memory (common workspace namespace)
